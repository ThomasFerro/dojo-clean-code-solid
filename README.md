# Coding Dojo - Clean Code - SOLID

> An introduction to Clean Code / Architecture in disguise.

A Coding Dojo based on the universe of Metal Gear Solid. Five exercises will be presented to introduce the principles behind the SOLID acronym.

## Introduction

**Transmission received...**

```
Snake, we need your help.

Our agent management system has been compromised and we are trying to rebuild another one in Node.js.

The system is used to keep track of all of our agents and their missions. No big deal for a clean coder like you, am I right ?

We are almost done, but something is missing, like if we were building the project without thinking of the maintainability, flexibility and understandability...

Your goal is to find the project's flaws and eliminate them. Our first analysis has shown that there is one of them per principle behind the SOLID acronym, whatever it means.
```

Follow the instructions and try to complete the exercises so you will have a proper introduction to the Clean Code / Clean Architecture as instructed by Uncle Bob !

For each section, you will have to checkout into the git branch with a flaw to fix. There is no perfect solution to those problems, try your best to clean the code but do not spend to much time scratching your head.

A branch with a solution is provided for every exercise, feel free to compare it with your own !

I highly recommend you to read "Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design" by Robert C. Martin after you completed the dojo. It contains a deeper dive into the SOLID principles and many more.
